<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>According to all known laws
of aviation,
 
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.</p>

 
<p>Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.
 
The bee, of course, flies anyway
 
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.</p>

BARRY BENSON:
(Barry is picking out a shirt)
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
JANET BENSON:
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
BARRY:
Coming!

Hang on a second.
(Barry uses his antenna like a phone)

Hello?
ADAM FLAYMAN:

(Through phone)
- Barry?
BARRY:
- Adam?
ADAM:
- Can you believe this is happening?
BARRY:
- I can't. I'll pick you up.
(Barry flies down the stairs)
